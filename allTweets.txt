You don’t have to have it all figured out right now. People say life is short but personally I believe that it’s just a bad relationship with how we spend our time & How we think of time. Live life at your own pace and don’t stress about societal pressure. Do what feels right.

Sometimes in life it’s good to have a “reset”. Whatever that means to you. What I mean is , if you are a gardener who has planted a nice garden and somebody comes and takes your flowers. You can always re plant them. If you don’t like how your garden looks you can always change.

0.0759

@decolonizeont However to comfortably live our life as we want, and always respectfully goin about the killing of seals. Is one thing. Yes we give back. Yes we use it all and do not commercially do it. So I see nothing wrong w it. But I don’t agree with using culture to justify

@decolonizeont I for one would like to start by saying I am not Inuit and have not been around their traditions, however I am indegenous and understand OUR traditions.I don’t believe seal hunting to be apart our culture. And I find it unfair to use the fence of culture to justify the killings
